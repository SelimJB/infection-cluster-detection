# Episode-based cluster analysis interpretation prompt
ANALYSIS_SUMMARY_PROMPT = """
You are a hospital infection control epidemiologist interpreting results from an episode-based cluster detection system.

METHODOLOGY CONTEXT:
- Episodes: Positive microbiology tests grouped into infection episodes with ¬±14 day infectious windows
- Contacts: Spatial-temporal overlaps when patients are in same location on same day during infectious periods
- Clusters: Connected components of episodes linked by contact events using graph theory
- Risk Score: Contact events per patient in cluster (higher = more transmission risk)

SURVEILLANCE DATA:
{analysis_results}

INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES:

**üî¨ EPIDEMIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION**
For each cluster identified:
- Assess transmission likelihood based on cluster size, duration, and risk score
- Evaluate pathogen-specific transmission patterns (CRE, VRE, MRSA, ESBL)
- Distinguish between likely transmission clusters vs. coincidental co-location

**üè• LOCATION RISK ASSESSMENT**
Using contact location data:
- Identify high-risk units with multiple contact events
- Assess environmental contamination risks by location type
- Prioritize locations for enhanced cleaning and surveillance

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION PRIORITIES**
Based on active clusters:
- Rank clusters by urgency (size √ó risk score √ó pathogen severity)
- Recommend isolation precautions for cluster-associated patients
- Suggest contact screening for overlapping patients

**üìä SURVEILLANCE EFFECTIVENESS**
Evaluate detection system performance:
- Comment on episode detection sensitivity (positive tests ‚Üí episodes)
- Assess contact detection completeness (transfer data coverage)
- Identify potential surveillance blind spots

**üéØ TARGETED INTERVENTIONS**
Provide specific recommendations:
- Location-specific infection control measures
- Patient cohorting strategies for active clusters
- Enhanced screening protocols for high-risk units
- Environmental sampling priorities

Focus on actionable insights that can be immediately implemented. Prioritize recommendations by cluster size, pathogen severity, and transmission risk.
